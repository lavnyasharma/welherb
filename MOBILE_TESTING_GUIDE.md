## Common Mobile Issues to Watch For

### If buttons still don't work:
1. **Clear browser cache**: Settings → Clear browsing data
2. **Hard refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
3. **Check console for errors**: Open DevTools → Console tab
4. **Verify z-index**: Inspect element → Check computed styles

### If layout looks broken:
1. **Check viewport width**: Should be mobile size
2. **Verify responsive breakpoints**: Resize browser window
3. **Test in different orientations**: Portrait and landscape

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Buttons still not clicking
**Solution:**
- Clear cache and hard refresh
- Check if JavaScript is enabled
- Verify no browser extensions are interfering

### Problem: Layout looks weird on mobile
**Solution:**
- Check viewport meta tag is correct
- Verify responsive CSS is loading
- Test in different browsers

### Problem: Tap delay still exists
**Solution:**

## Performance Checks

### Things to Monitor:
- [ ] Page load time on mobile
- [ ] Button response time (should be instant)
- [ ] Scroll performance (should be smooth)
- [ ] Image loading (should be fast)

### Using Chrome DevTools Performance:
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Click Record button
3. Interact with the page (tap buttons, scroll, etc.)
4. Stop recording
5. Look for:
   - Long tasks (should be minimal)
   - Input delay (should be < 100ms)
   - Frame rate (should be 60fps)

---

## Accessibility Checks (Bonus)

### Touch Target Sizes:
- All buttons should be **at least 44x44px**
- Easy to tap without zooming
- Adequate spacing between buttons

### Visual Feedback:
- Tap highlights should be visible
- Hover states should work (on desktop)
- Active states should be clear
