# Parallax Bottle Fix - Summary

## Issue
The parallax bottle animation was appearing on top of all components (even when background colors were applied) due to `position: fixed` without proper z-index management. This caused the bottle to overlay other content inappropriately.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Desktop Bottle Z-Index Issue
- **File**: `src/app/components/parallax/parallax.component.css`
- **Change**: Added `z-index: 1` to `.parallax-image` to ensure it stays below other components
- **Result**: The fixed-position bottle no longer overlays components with background colors

### 2. Added Mobile-Only Bottle Display
- **File**: `src/app/components/parallax/parallax.component.html`
- **Change**: Added a new `.mobile-bottle` div within the title section, placed directly after the button container
- **Result**: Bottle now appears below the buttons on mobile view only

### 3. Mobile Bottle Styling
- **File**: `src/app/components/parallax/parallax.component.css`
- **Changes**:
  - Created `.mobile-bottle` class with:
    - `display: none` by default (hidden on desktop)
    - `margin-top: 30px` for spacing below buttons
    - `max-width: 250px` for appropriate mobile sizing
    - Smooth `fadeInUp` animation for elegant appearance
  - Updated mobile media query to `display: block` for `.mobile-bottle`
  - Desktop parallax bottle remains hidden on mobile (already configured)

### 4. Button Z-Index Enhancement
- **File**: `src/app/components/parallax/parallax.component.css`
- **Change**: Added `z-index: 100` to `.button-container-buy-now`
- **Result**: Ensures all interactive buttons remain clickable and above other elements

## Files Modified
1. `/src/app/components/parallax/parallax.component.html`
2. `/src/app/components/parallax/parallax.component.css`

## Behavior

### Desktop (> 768px)
- Parallax bottle with animation remains visible
- Bottle has `z-index: 1` to stay below other components
- Mobile bottle is hidden

### Mobile (â‰¤ 768px)
- Parallax animated bottle is completely hidden
- Static bottle image appears below the "Shop Now" and "Learn More" buttons
- Bottle fades in with smooth animation
- Maximum width of 250px for optimal mobile display
- Bottle does not interfere with other components

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Desktop Testing**: Verify the parallax bottle animation doesn't overlay other components
2. **Mobile Testing**: 
   - Confirm bottle appears below buttons
   - Verify bottle is properly sized and centered
   - Check that fade-in animation works smoothly
   - Test on various mobile screen sizes (320px - 768px)
3. **Cross-component Testing**: Navigate to different pages and ensure no bottle overlay issues

## CSS Animation Details
```css
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```
Duration: 0.8s with ease-out timing function
