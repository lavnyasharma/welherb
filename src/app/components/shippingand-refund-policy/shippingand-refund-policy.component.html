        <h4>What is the COD order processing fee?</h4>
        <p>All COD orders carry a ₹70 processing fee.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> COD is a facility extended in good faith. Impulsive orders that are not honoured cause resource wastage. Every small step towards the preservation of resources matters. If you are doubtful, please write to us at {{ getSupportEmail() }} or call us at {{ getSupportPhone() }} before placing your order.</p>

        <h4>Do I have to confirm a COD order?</h4>
        <p>Yes, for a COD order, you will receive a confirmation request call or WhatsApp message on your registered mobile number. The order is processed only after confirmation. The confirmation link sent on WhatsApp is valid for 24 hours. In the event you are unable to confirm the order via WhatsApp (No WhatsApp access or expired link), kindly call us at {{ getSupportPhone() }} or write to us at {{ getSupportEmail() }} for order confirmation.</p>

        <h4>Payment Issue</h4>
        <p><strong>What should I do if the payment is debited but the order has not been placed?</strong></p>
        <p>If your payment is debited but the order isn't placed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check your internet connection and ensure the correct details were used.</li>
          <li>In most cases, the amount is auto-refunded within 7–14 business days.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For any assistance regarding payments, call us at {{ getSupportPhone() }} or write to us at {{ getSupportEmail() }}.</p>

        <h4>Order confirmation</h4>
        <p>Order confirmations are sent via WhatsApp and/or email upon successful placement. If you haven't received one, kindly check your spam folder or contact us. Additionally, it is also visible to you under the My Orders tab on your account page after you log in.</p>
