# Product Card Buy Now Implementation

## Summary
Implemented "Buy Now" and "Learn More" functionality in the product-card component to match the behavior of the shopall component.

## Changes Made

### 1. product-card.component.ts
- **Added imports:**
  - `Router` from '@angular/router'
  - `CartService` from '../../../services/cart.service'
  - `ToastrService` from 'ngx-toastr'

- **Updated constructor** to inject:
  - CartService
  - Router
  - ToastrService

- **Added `learnMore()` method:**
  - Navigates to the product detail page using the product `_id`
  - Route: `/shop/:id`

- **Added `buyNow()` method:**
  - Validates product availability
  - Checks user authentication (redirects to login if not authenticated)
  - Gets the first available size from the product
  - Adds product to cart using CartService
  - Shows success toast notification
  - Navigates to the cart page
  - Follows the same logic as shopall component's buy now functionality

### 2. product-card.component.html
- **Updated button event handlers:**
  - Learn More button: Added `(click)="learnMore()"`
  - Buy Now button: Added `(click)="buyNow()"`

## Functionality Flow

### Learn More Flow:
1. User clicks "Learn More" button
2. Component navigates to `/shop/:id` with the product's `_id`
3. User sees the full product details page

### Buy Now Flow:
1. User clicks "Buy Now" button
2. System checks if product exists
3. System checks if user is authenticated
   - If not authenticated: Redirects to login page with warning toast
   - If authenticated: Continues to next step
4. Gets the first available product size
5. Adds product to cart (if not already in cart)
6. Shows success toast notification
7. Navigates to cart page

## Key Features
- ✅ Product `_id` is correctly passed for routing
- ✅ Authentication check before purchase
- ✅ Same logic as shopall component's buy now
- ✅ User-friendly toast notifications
- ✅ Automatic cart addition and navigation
- ✅ Size selection (uses first available size)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention (checks if already in cart)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test "Learn More" button - should navigate to product detail page
2. Test "Buy Now" as unauthenticated user - should redirect to login
3. Test "Buy Now" as authenticated user - should add to cart and navigate
4. Verify the correct product `_id` is being passed
5. Check toast notifications appear correctly
6. Verify cart updates with correct product and size
